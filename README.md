## Description
A social media application for hikers and trail goers. You can search National Park trails throughout the US.  Allow users to create profiles which will store all trails they have hiked, ones they hope to complete in the future and all them to post, rank, and comment on them. Users can connect with other hikers using the app. 

## Installation
For this project, we created a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, combining a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. We started with the backend, making sure the server was working. We tested each query and mutation in GraphQL, and then implemented it into the front-end components. Using a National Park API, we were able to search trails on our Trail page. We used .jsx, which was a new type of file. We styled the front-end using React and Bootstrap. 

## Usage
HelloHiker is a useful application for people who are looking for a community of hikers. In this one app, you can search for trails to hike, and connect with fellow hikers. The site also has valuable information about National Parks and trails.
