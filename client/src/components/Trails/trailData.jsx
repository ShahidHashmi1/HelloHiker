            name: 'Half Dome Hike - Yosemite National Park, California',
            description: 'Half Dome is one of the most iconic landmarks in Yosemite National Park and an epic hike that is challenging and rewarding. This hike is 14 to 16 miles round-trip and only for experienced hikers. When you hike this route, you’ll see so many amazing sites along the way, including Vernal and Nevada Falls and Liberty Cap. It takes most people about 10 to 12 hours to hike to the end and back, so make sure to leave by sunrise or even earlier if you want to make this a day hike. You should also be aware that the last 400 feet to the summit are accessed by cables that are a big adventure too! The cables are typically in place between Memorial Day and Columbus Day.',

            name: 'Precipice Trail - Acadia National Park, Maine',
            description: 'The Precipice Trail is a short but steep and challenging hike in beautiful Acadia National Park. It’s only about 2.5 miles long, but the elevation gain is about 1,060 feet. The hike involves climbing up metal ladders, passing along narrow ledges, and being pretty comfortable with heights as you look down from the cliffs. The best time to do this hike is in the late summer and early fall so that you don’t run into falcon nesting time or the snow and ice of winter. Most people take about two to three hours to complete this stunning hike as you go up to the summit of Champlain Mountain.',

            description: 'Harding Icefield Trail is an 8.2-mile round trip route that leaves from the Exit Glacier Area in Kenai Fjords National Park. You can learn about past ice ages on this trail with ice and snow as far as you can see. Get ready for a strenuous trek though because you gain about a thousand feet of elevation with each mile you go. Most hikers take about six to eight hours to do this hike in full, but you can also do an abbreviated version of it and get an amazing experience too. You’ll find snow on the trail until early July each year and also run the risk of avalanches. To make a multi-day trip out of this hike, you can camp overnight at least 1/8 mile from the trail on bare rock or snow. Just be aware this is black bear country!',

            description: 'There are lots of scenic hikes in the Columbia River Gorge, including the Eagle Creek Trail that is temporarily closed but we hope will reopen again soon! It was closed due to a wildfire and subsequent landslides but is generally one of the most popular hikes in the area because of its dramatic cliffs, waterfalls, and High Bridge that traverses a narrow gorge. This is a hike that’s not for the faint of heart, small children, or anyone who’s afraid of heights. Check the U.S. Forest Service website for updates about the reopening of this trail.',

            name: 'Grinnell Glacier Trail - Glacier National Park, Montana',
            description: 'The Grinnell Glacier Trail is about 10.3 miles, with the first couple miles following Swiftcurrent Lake and Lake Josephine. You’ll get views of Grinnell Falls, Angel Wing, Mount Gould, and Grinnell Lake as you go along and follow the trail. If you want a shorter hike, you can take a boat ride across the lake and get in about seven miles instead of 10.3. The full hike will take you about five to seven hours and is best to hike between mid-June and September when there’s no snow here.',
